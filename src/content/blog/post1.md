# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/post1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!



#### Output

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.<br>
